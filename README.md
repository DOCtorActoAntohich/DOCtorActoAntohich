Hello I'm DOC

I exist sometimes ![](https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/:ohh_yeah:)

### About me?!?!

This is a stupid section, but I was offered to add it for memes, so...

What I think about popular languages:
- C++ is cursed and I love it...
- C# is adorkable and I love it...
- Python is funny and I love it...
- Java - _[A boilerplate-driven language designed for writing verbose object-oriented instant legacy code](https://youtu.be/m4-HM_sCvtQ)_.
- C must die.

Technologies that I love:
- Unity - I hate Unity ![](https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/:ohh_yeah:)
- Docker Compose - but screw setting it up.
- MongoDB - because JSONs are epic.
- Redis - _Simple is better than complex._ (`import this`)
- VS Code - Thank you for IntelliSense, bro.
- `nano`

### Projects

- [Bad Games Studio](https://github.com/Bad-Games-Studio) - game-related repositories, mostly Unity demos.
